# ender-v0
A Voron v0 modified and upscaled to an Ender 5 frame. 

There is a work-in-progress BOM, if there is enough interest I will finish it.

Up-next:
- Larger build plate and improved Z-axis assembly
- Tophat similar to the Voron v0
- Move electronics to the rear and mount on DIN 3 rails similar to the Voron v2
